MOTHUR WORKFLOW: README
=======================

Background/Overview
-------------------

These scripts perform an automated metagenomic analysis of sequencing data sets
from a Roche454 16s or 18s rRNA sequence project from environmental or tissure
samples. The analysis clusters the sequences at various levels of similarity to
give an indication of the distinct organisms within the sample. The analysis can
be applied to both a single sample or multiple samples, for example drawn from
two separate locations.

There are three scripts:

   - m_noise.sh: prepare the inputs for clustering by "de-noise"-ing sequencing errors
   - m_sample_cluster.sh: perform metagenomic analysis for a single sample
   - m_samples_cluster.sh: perform metagenomic analysis for multiple samples

Typical usage is to run m_noise.sh first to clean up the data and prepare input for
the clustering procedure, which is then performed by running either m_sample_cluster.sh
(single sample clustering analysis) or m_samples_cluster.sh (multiple samples).

The multiple sample analysis script is preferred over the single sample version, but
requires intense computational resources and so is only suitable for running on HPC
systems.

The clustering scripts produce a large number of outputs which are described below.

General setup and requirements
------------------------------

The minimum requirements are:

    - mothur 1.23
    - reference data files for performing the analysis

Install mothur

   - Download mothur from http://www.mothur.org
   - Either build from source or get the pre-built binaries for your platform

Reference data

   The following data files are required. By default lookup files are expected to
   be in $HOME/mothur and reference alignments in $HOME/ref_data; these locations can
   be overridden by setting the MOTHUR_LOOKUP and MOTHUR_REF_DATA environment
   variables, e.g.

     % export MOTHUR_LOOKUP=$HOME/mothur/lookups
     % export MOTHUR_REF_DATA=$HOME/mothur/ref_alignments

   The `setup_mothur.sh` script can be run to automatically download and unpack the
   reference data in the appropriate places automatically.

   - Mothur lookup files needed to run shhh.flows:

     See index page with reference files at http://www.mothur.org/wiki/Lookup_files

     http://www.mothur.org/w/images/9/96/LookUp_Titanium.zip
     http://www.mothur.org/w/images/8/84/LookUp_GSFLX.zip
     http://www.mothur.org/w/images/7/7b/LookUp_GS20.zip

     These should be unpacked in the directory $HOME/mothur/

   - Reference database files for mothur's aligner:

     See index page at http://www.mothur.org/wiki/Alignment_database

     There are two databases for rRNA gene sequences provided:

     * Greengenes-based alignments http://www.mothur.org/wiki/Greengenes-formatted_databases

       The specific files to download are:

                  http://www.mothur.org/w/images/7/72/Greengenes.alignment.zip
       	    	  http://www.mothur.org/w/images/2/21/Greengenes.gold.alignment.zip
		  http://www.mothur.org/w/images/1/16/Greengenes.tax.tgz

     * SILVA reference data http://www.mothur.org/wiki/Silva_reference_files

       The specific files to download are:

		  http://www.mothur.org/w/images/9/98/Silva.bacteria.zip
		  http://www.mothur.org/w/images/3/3c/Silva.archaea.zip
		  http://www.mothur.org/w/images/1/1a/Silva.eukarya.zip
		  http://www.mothur.org/w/images/f/f1/Silva.gold.bacteria.zip

     Download these files and put into a reference database directory:
     $HOME/ref_data/

     NB for silva.bacteria: the files unpack into a subdirectory silva.bacteria
     but m_noise.sh expects them to be in $HOME/ref_data:

     % unzip Silva.bacteria.zip
     % mv silva.bacteria/* .
     % rm -rf silva.bacteria

Additional tools

A tree viewing utility such as TreeVector (http://supfam.cs.bris.ac.uk/TreeVector/about.html)
or FastTree is useful for rendering plots of the phylogenetic tree data output from the
clustering analysis. TreeVector can be downloaded or used as an online tool.

Input Data
----------

The workflow requires an SFF (Standard flowgram format) file containing pyrosequencing
results produced by the 454 Life Sciences platform, and an oligos file which contains
the sequences of the forward and reverse primers and the barcodes for each sample
(see the mothur documentation for more information on the oligos file:
http://www.mothur.org/wiki/Trim.flows#oligos).

Running the scripts
-------------------

0. Before running the scripts make sure that you set the MOTHUR_LOOKUP and MOTHUR_REF_DATA
   environment variables if the lookup and reference alignment data are installed in a
   location other than $HOME/mothur and $HOME/ref_data (see the section on "Reference data"
   above).

1. m_noise.sh: data preparation by "de-noising"

   The data preparation step must be performed for each sample that will be analysed. It
   is run using:

   % m_noise.sh <sff_file>

   Note that this needs to be run in the same directory as the input <sff_file>, and that
   an oligo file called "map.oligos" must also be present.

   This uses the "seqnoise" function in mothur to clean up sequence data for input into
   the clustering step. It produces several output files; the most important are:

   - the final FASTA file "<base>.trim.shhh.trim.unique.good.filter.fasta", and
   - "<base>.trim.shhh.trim.good.names" file contains the names of the sequences that were
     processed

   These are needed as input to the clustering analysis step.

   You also need the "groups" file for running the multiple sample clustering:

   - the "<base>.trim.shhh.trim.unique.good.filter.groups" file (needed for multiple sample
     analysis only)

2.1 m_sample_cluster.sh: cluster analysis for a single sample

   This clusters sequences into distinct groups, with each cluster/group indicating a
   different species. This script works with a single sample.

   Run by supplying the FASTA and ".good.names" files from the de-noising step as input:

   % m_sample_cluster.sh <base>.trim.shhh.trim.unique.good.filter.fasta

   See "Outputs and interpretation" below for information on the output files.

2.2 m_samples_cluster.sh: cluster analysis for multiple samples

   This clusters sequences from multiple samples:

   % m_samples_cluster.sh

   No arguments are required as this script operates on all the files it finds in the
   working directory. It expects the following outputs from the m_noise.sh step for
   each sample:

   - *.trim.shhh.trim.unique.good.filter.groups
   - *.trim.shhh.trim.unique.good.filter.fasta
   - *.trim.shhh.trim.good.names

   The script combines all the matching files it finds into "merge.groups", "merge.fasta"
   and "merge.names" files respectively.

   Because this is so computationally intensive it should be run on a suitable HPC
   facility (see below).

   See "Outputs and interpretation" below for information on the output files.

Outputs and interpretation
--------------------------

The following outputs are produced by the m_sample_cluster.sh script:

 - *.tre: tree data (use e.g. TreeVector to render as a plot for viewing)

 - *.taxonomy: phylogenetic classification of group of sequences (i.e. OTUs)

 - *.tax.summary: summary of the taxonomy file

 - *.rarefaction: gives an indication of whether the sample size is adequate; gives OTU
   ("operational taxonomic units") as a function of sequences.

 - *.rep.*: representative sequences from each cluster

For the m_samples_cluster.sh script additional outputs are produced:

 - *.phylodiv.*: phylodiversity information

 - heatmaps: *.heatmap.bin (diversity) or *.heatmap.sim (similarity)

 - Venn diagrams: SVG files showing overlaps between samples (look for sample names in
   the file name e.g. "*N0_1-N1_1-O1_1.svg"

Also outputs:

 - *.list: outputs groups of sequences as a function of "distance levels" (generally
   larger distances result in fewer groups with more sequences per group). Not normally
   looked at directly.

Running the workflow on different platforms (desktop versus cluster)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

m_noise.sh and m_sample_cluster.sh are suitable for running on a deskop computer;
to take advantage of multiple cores, change the value of the NSLOTS variable in
the scripts to the preferred number of cores.

m_samples_cluster.sh is computationally intensive and it is probably more desirable
to run this on a HPC cluster. To use the scripts on a HPC platform that supports
Grid Engine (GE):

 - comment out the NSLOTS setting in each script
 - edit the GE directives at the head of the script as appropriate

The scripts should be submitted using the standard qsub command, e.g.

% qsub -N denoise m_noise.sh sample.sff

Hints and tips
--------------

- mothur 1.23.1 bug in shhh.flows command

  There is a minor bug in the mothur 1.23.1 'shhh.flows' command, which adds extra dots
  into the output file names and causes the m_noise.sh script to fail.
  Either use mothur 1.23.0, or build a patched version of 1.23.1 - see the fix on the
  mothur forum http://www.mothur.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=1492
